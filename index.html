<h1> Volcanoes </h1>
<h2> What is a Volcano? </h2>

<p>A volcano is a rupture in the crust of a planetary-mass object, such as Earth, that allows hot lava, volcanic ash, and gases to escape from a magma chamber below the surface.</p>
<h2> Why do Volcanoes Occur?</h2>
<p>Earth's volcanoes occur because its crust is broken into 17 major, rigid tectonics plates that float on a hotter, softer layer in its mantle. Therefore, on Earth, volcanoes are generally found where the tectonics plates are diverging or converging, and most are found underwater. Volcanoes can also form where there is stretching and thinning of the crust's plates, e.g., in the East African Rift and the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field.</p>
